# my-karabiner-rules

These are the "complex modifications" I use for keyboard remappings using Karabiner on mac.

The files in this repo go in the `/Users/{user}/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications` folder. Open Karabiner, go to the `Complex modifications` tab, click `+ Add rule`, and select the rules that you want to enable.
